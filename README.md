This was my final assignment for _Partial Degree in Information and
Communication Technology: Maintenance of Cybersecurity_ ending on 2024-10-11.

Due to burnout I was unable to finish it and turned in the version `git tag`ged
as `2024.40.0`.

Regardless this is an important subject and I always planned to publish the
repository after graduating, so the repository will be made public later.

I make no promises on finishing or returning to this as WiFi is constantly
evolving and during the time of writing and my adventures in seeking help with
mental health, iOS 18 was released featuring a swich on whether to always
randomize MAC Address or keep a static random one per network making MAC
filtering even less useful feature. I don't remember does the pdf go into
Android Developer settings having had similar option for ages.

I just hope this is of some use to anyone who happens to read it.

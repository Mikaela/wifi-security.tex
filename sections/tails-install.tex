\chapter{Installing TAILS}

\section{How TAILS replaced Kali Linux in this work}

I was first going to go with Kali Linux, but eventually decided it's not that great match for this assignment, regardless of how great it is in general.

While this could be done using a virtual machine, it would require more configuration and all. I did create an USB installation of Kali Linux, but it's not designed for that and seems to work on only about every second computer I plug it in, and I needed to perform systemd-bootd installation and a lot of other things to get where I was with it.

Kali also has a lot of tools that are unrelated to this purpose and TAILS also has the advantage of having MAC Address spoofing out of the box and warning us when it fails to enable it. Thus we would have plausible deniability, if we weren't writing, reviewing or otherwise reading a document on WiFi security analysisâ€¦

\chapter{Used hardware}

This is a bit weird project with WiFi being universal (and unavoidable), so this is written with whatever I got at hand in mind.

Accessing WiFi network interface card on a lower level may get complicated, so the installation section is written in virtual machine, while then suddenly jumping to a prior installation on USB stick performed through another USB stick and grub replaced with systemd-bootd, although that is a bit irrelevant.

I am mainly typing this section to get my thoughts in order and to avoid the blank paper syndrome.

Other devices include my WiFi AP, MikroTik Chateau 5G, the Kali Linux is currently running on ASUS X550JX and I have also discovered a mysterious WiFi adapter from a box, which I should test for monitoring mode ability.

I aÄºso have a GPS adapter hanging from my curtains and a bag full of different WiFi access points...

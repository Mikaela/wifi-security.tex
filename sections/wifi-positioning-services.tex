\chapter{WiFi positioning services}

\section{WiFi Privacy isn't only between your client and AP}

Since the advent of GPS personal navigation technology has been becoming increasingly common and in addition to cars, smartphones and even smartwatches or smart rings may come with a GPS nowadays.

However the traditional positioning systems may not function well when the client is located between high buildings, indoors or even tunnels and at some point, businesses decided to start collecting WiFi Access Point MAC addresses and locations for reliable positioning anywhere with a WiFi access.

The largest of these databases likely belong to Google, Apple and Microsoft considering how with default settings their operating systems Android and iOS contribute into them.

\subsection{TODO: Microsoft}

TODO: How does Microsoft do it? Any Microsoft app with access to local networks? They do it \autocite{Microsoft_nomap}, but is it just any app that is given access to location and nearby devices?
